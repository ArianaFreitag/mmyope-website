			<p>this issue focuses on chinatown in the midst of the ongoing, and justly lambasted, construction of the world's tallest jail (40 stories for 886 inmates) being built in the heart of the neighborhood.</p>
			<br>
			<p>an artist is running a food bank from their house, inviting people to cook together and feed those that don't have access to reliable meals.</p>
			<br>
			<p>a friend goes and visits a park, reviews the experience for us. someone else listens to an album and recommends it. a musician interviewed for mmyope radio drops by and shares a recipe for when you're in a pinch. <br> these sort of things happen around here.</p>
